Project Assignment #1: ENERGY CONSUMPTION VS PRODUCTION CONTRAST PRE - POST PANDEMIC

**• An introduction of your research question**

In the last couple of years, the world experimented an unusual drift in demand and supply of energy due to the pandemic restrictions; many industries got affected and nobody was prepared for such extraordinary event. Thereby, understanding our past and making a contrast between the actual energy spending and previous expectations of it would be useful to help in the development of a better approach for a predictive model. We are prone to keep having these pandemic events in the long, however, the data to analyze is not trustful from the majority of sources; for that reason, I narrowed my scope of research to analyze the data from CORGIS, and choosing the United States Energy dataset, moreover, for this research I considered analyzing as my sample, the five most populated States from the country.

**•	An explanation of why it is important to you, why it matters to others, and what is at stake**

This topic is important for me because as a personal illustration of it, during February 2021 I moved to Houston, TEXAS and it is unusual to have snow storm there, however I moved exactly a few days before the storm and almost 50% of the city run out of power, I’m not an expert but I’ve heard that Houston is the energy capital of the World so that should have not happened, things turned out to be worsened when the waterpipes frozened, the major stores run out of products, and many other. Indeed, what I heard constantly in the news was that the energy consumption increased significantly also because people were at home all day (because of the restrictions and because everything was closed) and the heat was on all day, for that reason the energy supply was not being enough. 
What I consider at stake within this research is mainly on knowing which is State could be more convenient on behalf of cheaper energy supply but at the same time that the demand is not over expecting to the point that can become prejudicial in an extraordinary event.

**•	A preliminary but definitive description of data sources that you will use**

	Include data sources with links

The data sources I’ll be using are CORGIS, the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and IEA.org (International Energy Agency)
https://www.eia.gov/state/seds/seds-data-complete.php
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) collects, analyzes, and disseminates independent and impartial energy information to promote sound policymaking, efficient markets, and public understanding of energy and its interaction with the economy and the environment.

The Collection of Really Great, Interesting, Situated Datasets
By Austin Cory Bart, Ryan Whitcomb, Jason Riddle, Omar Saleem, Dr. Eli Tilevich, Dr. Clifford A. Shaffer, Dr. Dennis Kafura

https://www.iea.org/
The IEA is at the heart of global dialogue on energy, providing authoritative analysis, data, policy recommendations, and real-world solutions to help countries provide secure and sustainable energy for all.
The IEA was created in 1974 to help co-ordinate a collective response to major disruptions in the supply of oil. While oil security this remains a key aspect of our work, the IEA has evolved and expanded significantly since its foundation.

**•	A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project**

   o	This may change a lot in the next few weeks as we learn more about analysis and visualization
   o	For the present moment, make an educated estimate
      The overall consumption increased by more than 15%
      The overall production decreased by at least 9%
      
**•	A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research**

A more accurate understanding of how the restrictions played a significant role on the impact of energy consumption and supply. As well as contrasting this sample’s result with the general consumption of the country.
